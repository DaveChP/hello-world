# hello-world
An addition made in the local repository AFTER an earlier addition made to origin

My oh my, grapling security keys can be frustrating. Thank goodness for github's documents pages.

I used the default correction for a failed pull due to changes on remote version. Then pulled. merge failed by conflicts. Opened file in vim, deleted pink bits (except the title) and added some text here

Another local edit to add double returns to text file for markdown paragraphs
